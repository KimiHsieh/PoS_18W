The supercomputer system used in this course is [SuperMUC](https://www.lrz.de/services/compute/supermuc/).

# Course Description # 
An application is given to the students that has to be optimized first for
sequential execution. It then has to be parallelized with OpenMP and MPI and run with
different processors configuration in interactive and batch mode. Performance
analysis tools are applied to help in the parallel optimization.
